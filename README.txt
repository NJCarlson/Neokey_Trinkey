Optional 3D Printed Case - Originally by Matthew Barlow
https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/75222-case-for-adafruit-neokey-trinkey 

Notes on Matthew's case files:

- The PCB tilts in at the back, and the top piece locks the board in place around the key.
- There is NO WAY to access the capcitive touch sensor with this case.

Future Plans:
- Add more features to the .ino, such as:
	+ find a way to run scripts on the connected computer.
	+  open to suggestions!
	
- Remix Matthew's case to add features such as:
 	+ a hole for a keychain
	+ access to the capacitive touch sensor
	+ make it water proof / resistant by adding a cover to the switch / USB port
